# Restaurant review app

##Intro
The starter code was provided by Udacity with project specifications to turn a static web page into a mobile-ready application. 

### Specification
Here are the specification provided by Udacity:
> You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. Its barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesnt include any standard accessibility features, and it doesnt work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

### Solution
The "Restaurant review" app has been converted into a responsive, mobile-ready and offline first app. I have made the app responsive and have added accessibility features using ARIA specification.

The app works offline too by using service worker and cache.

### Steps to run locally
